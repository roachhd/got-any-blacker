#Hug Wolf

Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land. Then lets burn its butt down to the roof rubbins. (The duo walks forward.) Finn, I can feel a bunch a eyeballs peepin us from the woods. Hhyuuugs!

What the?! Is this an extra butt?! Quick, Jake! Burn the tree! Huuuugs! (Finn grunts and they begin circling each other) Gonna cut you up, boy! Im gonna snuggle you to pieces!

>Dude!! The trees about to splode its evil juice all over!
I didn't hug you last night.

###Yes, you did!
My love handles still hurt!
You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze
a really strong one! No! Jake, hurry! Is he crushin you, man?! No, he's just... hugging me gently! Oh...! When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell im Jake says, Hello.

Hey, buddy, you okay? Didn't even tell me its name. Wha? Oh, sweet! Hahaha!
need a good nights sleep.

You feelin better today?

>Yeah. I feel like a million clams. 

Good
. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter? Litter for lunch! Mmm! Huh? Not again! What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun? Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night.

###CB says I hugged im.
Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya. Oh, Cinnamon Bun. What a crazy story, buddy. Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy. Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Buns room and hugged him, do you? Im just sayin you were really clingy. But no. Why would I? And don't tell me its because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.
